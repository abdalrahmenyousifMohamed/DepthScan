##  Workflow Overview

1. **Planning**
   - Decompose the user query into focused sub-queries.
2. **Searching**
   - Perform web search and collect top results.
3. **Summarizing**
   - Use LLM to reduce content length while preserving meaning.
4. **Ranking**
   - Rank sources by relevance and reliability.
5. **Self-Reflection**
   - Check for knowledge gaps or missing components.
6. **Writing**
   - Aggregate insights into a clean, coherent research report.

##  Example Use Case

**Query**:  
> "What are the five largest companies in the green/renewable energy sector by market capitalization, and what are their current stock prices?"

**Execution Plan**:
1. Planner identifies need to:
   - Search for top green energy companies.
   - Get their market cap and stock price.
2. Sources retrieved, summarized, and ranked.
3. JSON extractor pulls relevant financial data.
4. Writer generates report with citations.

#  Strategy2: Modular Agent-Based Research Workflow

`strategy2` is a structured, agent-based system for executing iterative and deep research workflows using a combination of modular LLM agents and research tools. This framework emphasizes flexibility, structured outputs, and high-quality synthesis using both open-source and proprietary language models.

---

##  Open-Source Models Used

| Purpose                    | Model Name                                     | Role                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Function Calling           | `hivata/functionary-small-v3.2-AWQ`           | Selects appropriate tools based on user queries and context         |
| Structured JSON Output     | `AMead10/SuperNova-Medius-AWQ`                | Generates clean, nested JSON from unstructured LLM outputs          |

These models are chosen for their performance, efficiency, and strong prompt adherence in structured automation tasks.

##  Agent System Overview

- **Knowledge Gap Agent**  
  Identifies gaps in collected information and suggests additional areas for research.

- **Tool Selector Agent**  
  Determines the appropriate research tools to invoke for filling knowledge gaps.

- **Tool Agents**  
  Specialized modules that perform individual tasks:
  - `Web Search Agent`: Queries the web to find information
  - `Website Crawler Agent`: Extracts and processes content from targeted sites

- **Writer Agent**  
  Synthesizes the information into well-structured, readable research reports.

---

##  Core Components

- **IterativeResearcher**  
  Executes an in-depth iterative research loop on a single topic or question.

- **DeepResearcher**  
  Coordinates multiple IterativeResearchers in parallel with an initial outline and final synthesis step.

- **LLMConfig**  
  Manages and abstracts model usage to support plug-and-play with various models.

##  Model Strategy (Proprietary)

We use OpenAI models in strategic roles based on performance and cost benchmarks:

| Task            | Model            | Reason                                                              |
|----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tool Selection  | `gpt-4o-mini`    | Cost-effective and accurate; performs better than `o3-mini`         |
| Planning        | `o3-mini`        | Strong for multi-step task and long-term planning                   |
| Final Writing   | `gpt-4o`         | High-quality generation and language fluency                        |

---

##  Research Tools

- **Web Search**  
  Interfaces with search engines to retrieve the most relevant information from SERP results.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization & Extensibility

- Tool agents are modular and extensible ‚Äî you can plug in your own web scrapers, knowledge bases, or API wrappers.
- Language models can be swapped easily via `LLMConfig`.
